# Hokuto no Ken API reporting

This package uses [newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) to run a [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) collection, build a html report, and deploy it as a static site.

Install the dependencies with:

```sh
yarn
```

Then build the html report and deploy it with:

```sh
yarn report
```

Here is the latest [html report](hokuto-no-ken-api-report.surge.sh) deployed on [surge](https://surge.sh/).
